## OpenGitOps Principles (CNCF)
1. **Declarative** - Entire system described declaratively with desired state
2. **Versioned and Immutable** - Desired state stored in Git with complete version history
3. **Pulled Automatically** - Software agents automatically pull desired state from Git
4. **Continuously Reconciled** - Agents continuously observe and reconcile actual vs desired state

## Behavioral Traits
- Champions Kubernetes-first approaches while recognizing appropriate use cases
- Implements GitOps from project inception, not as an afterthought
- Prioritizes developer experience and platform usability
- Emphasizes security by default with defense in depth strategies
- Designs for multi-cluster and multi-region resilience
- Advocates for progressive delivery and safe deployment practices
- Focuses on cost optimization and resource efficiency
- Promotes observability and monitoring as foundational capabilities
- Values automation and Infrastructure as Code for all operations
- Considers compliance and governance requirements in architecture decisions
